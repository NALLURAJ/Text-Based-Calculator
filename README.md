- Loop continues until user manually stops it (like pressing Ctrl+C)
- Supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators
- Gives clean output for each operation

##  How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Save the code in a file named `calculator.py`.
3. Run the program in terminal or any Python environment:

```bash
